There is a distinction between social media platforms and personal media platforms. One could imagine that this relationship is somewhat of a spectrum, where Twitter is closer to the end of social media, while platforms like Pinterest sit on the opposite end in the personal media space.

A way to measure this is to monitor how users are utilizing the platform. Applications like Pinterest and Google are primarily used as search engine to find information while applications like Facebook are closer to communications and entertainment that is meant to discover information. Interestingly enough, when examined this way, one could argue that Pinterest and Twitter has achieved what Google+ had failed to accomplish in a spectacular way - a connection platform based on search, ideas, and images. 

It's important to understand this distinction when investing in internet forums like Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and future opportunities like Reddit because an investor would not want to make strong relationships between companies like Home Depot or Walmart. Sure, both organizations exist in the retailing space, but the nature of the business, its incentives, and its customers are worlds apart. 

Is Pinterest a social media platform or is it a search service?

## 3.2. Investing in Internet Forums
Let’s keep one question in mind: Did Facebook’s implementation of a hashtag kill Twitter?

What drives a social-networking site is a user’s incentive to search or discover information in that particular forum. As a result, examining social-networking sites can be a lot like comparing shopping centers, such that a shopper is incentivized to go to a location for a particular reason that is served by that institution. Pinterest uses pins, Reddit uses subreddits, and Google uses links - all having unique advantages as a means to distribute information.

The forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. If we try to categorize it rough a forum's shopping center would look like this:
- Google is fueled by user’s need for answered information.
- Facebook is fueled by a user’s need to connect.
- Pinterest is fueled by a user’s need for ideas.
- Reddit is fueled by a user’s need for community.
- Online video games are fueled by a user’s need for adventure.

With this basic model, you can argue which forum may be most valuable. In my view, it ranks like this, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior:
1. Google (need for information)
2. Games (need for adventure)
3. Reddit (need for community)
4. Pinterest (need for ideas)
5. Facebook (need to connect)

I believe that people really underestimate how quickly humans find new ways to connect and can move to another platform for connection; which is also quite a common occurrence in online gaming.  The reason I rank Facebook as one of the weakest long-term relationships is because we have witnessed multiple transformations in the connection space, while the company has had to take advantage of early acquisitions to essentially escape death through WhatsApp and Instagram. Even today, we see attempts by Facebook to enter markets in children, workspace, groups, and shopping as a means to resist consumer behavior changes made organizations like TikTok, Discord, Roblox, Slack, and Pinterest. Instagram entered Shops to compete with Pinterest, not Amazon.

## 2.2. Search

Searching
Consider this economic relationship:  what are the demographics of male underwear shoppers and who do male underwear brands market to? Women. Why?

The network-effect that built Pinterest has mostly been driven by women across all social-economic statuses, resulting in  profound economic consequences across global households. What this ultimately results in word-of-mouth adoption, where families learn how to use Pinterest as a tool and search engine for ideas, rather than an application to connect with friends or family. As a result, Pinterest’s recommendation model is geared to advertise to women-influenced interests, which we will touch on shortly.

What this means is that Pinterest is closer to the adoption of applications like YouTube or even Reddit in some cases, where users aren't necessarily sharing their profiles with friends and use the applications to search for information that they find meaningful to them. In the same way that a user on Reddit searches for a group's opinion, or a YouTube customer searches for tutorials, Pinterest is used to generate and discover ideas.

This has long-term positive consequences for product advertisers regardless of culture - which is exactly why Pinterest is performing remarkably well with international user adoption, while most of the American customers have already been effectively registered, where nearly 100 million American women are monthly active users.

You can try it yourself to understand; it feels like what you wish Google Images to do for you at times:
- Recipe, Exercise, and Diet ideas (Peloton)
- Birthday gift ideas (Michaels, Corsair)
- Skincare ideas (Target, Hims & Hers)
- Tips for traveling to another area (AirBnB)
- Home construction (Sherwin-Williams, James hardie)
- Omnichannel support from places like TikTok, Zoom, Etsy

These are customers voluntarily searching for ads. Behaviorally, this means that Pinterest’s customers are in a “high willingness to engage” with things that result in “action”. That is, a Pinterest user is logging in because they need to start, plan, and consume something in the near future. Customers do not need to be influenced into a product when the customer is coming onto the application with completely different expectations and incentives to search and shop. This is basically a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know they’re getting top "real estate" on BOTH Google and Pinterest as a result of Pinterest's product design.

Pinterest users have an incredibly high willingness to engage as a function of using the social platform as a useful tool above all else. This willingness to engage inevitably translates into a willingness to pay. Pinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content to discover random nuggets of entertainment. It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy outside of Pinterest so that the customer develops a positive relationship with the tool. That is fundamentally different than Facebook’s connect-everything approach to social-networking.

## 2.3. Search Engine Optimization

You may wonder why Pinterest essentially dominates the Google Images real estate when searching for particular images. This is a pretty complicated question to answer since the search engine optimization market is relatively new. As a rule of thumb, try to imagine that Google Search is more or less "the web" where website links are to Google what subreddits are to Reddit. 

Due to this relationship, it's in Google's interest to attempt to create a system that best serves their customer by offering the best results. What this inevitably results in is that the most utilized or most well-developed websites are often the top results in a Google search.  This partially explains why searching for "Lebron James" today will result in search results by websites like Twitter, Wikipedia, Instagram, and other supersites.  Similarly, searching for "Vegan food near me" will produce results by organizations like Yelp and Doordash.

There are many other reasons of course, but this is a rough rule of thumb: the more "well-developed" a website is, the more likely that it will dominate web search results. As the web progresses, the definition of "well-developed" changes. An example of this is that Google begins to rank and prefer websites that implement privacy, page-load speed, and other important internet accessibility practices. This benefits organizations like Pinterest who develops tools like in-app browsers and supports integrations with applications like Zoom, Etsy, Shopify, and other large-scale platforms.

Why is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor and global leader. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet’s development to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe. The internet is ultimately “access to information”, which is as scarce as “access to clean water” around the globe. So it’s carefully considered in strong engineering communities. In this regard, Google and Facebook compete rather aggressively.

### Conclusion 
I totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life which is one of the most inelastic markets to breech. I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest customers are essentially sustainable top-dollar advertising spaces since users are looking directly to consume as a result of their usage which is far different than other social-media platform strategies with influencing.

I use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest - I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. This is why Facebook is concerned with daily active users while Pinterest is centrally focused on its monthly active userbase. That, to me, is incredible.
