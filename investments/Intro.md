### Chapter 1 - Purpose

>"“There is no better teacher than history in determining the future... There are answers worth billions of dollars in 30$ history book.”  - Charlie Munger in Poor Charlie's Almanac.

Hello there! My goal with these chapters is to write about increasingly complicated subjects in simple terms, such that any curious mind can engage and provoke wonder on the subjects. Many readers here want to learn to invest, and this document should provide as a form of inspiration and insight into what it means to be a proper investor that is able to set aggressive risks with confidence. 

If it's of any value, I am a 27 year old software engineer at the time of this writing. I began working when I was 12 and come from a background of formerly undocumented parents who crossed the border as teens. I began to work with technology around the same time by hacking video games on my own and learning factory technology with my father. As you can imagine, the subjects of technology, labor, and education are things that I was kind of born into, and in a way, this document is an expression of that experience.

If I were to highlight some of my main views on the world, it would be the following:

1. We live in one of the most transformational period in human history, and the economic consequence of technology is just about impossible to understate. In some ways,  our ability to gather in a website like this, or a platform like TikTok is no different than the first humans that have gathered and left paintings on caves thousands of years ago. That is, human history will never be the same after the discovery of modern computing in the 20th and 21st century.

2. I believe that the ability to distribute education will have profound effects on the liberties of women in particular.

3.  The most important element to investing is understanding consumer behavior and the incentives that drive those behaviors.

4. My principles for investing are derived from Charlie Munger and Warren Buffet, and I believe they are the best resources for understanding what it means to be an intelligent investor. I highly reccommend to spend a significant amount of time listening to these two as it is a privilege to effectively listen to some of the most legendary philosophers on the subject.
