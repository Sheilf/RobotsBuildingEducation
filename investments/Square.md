### Introduction

Before beginning this essay, I would like to ask a reader to consider the context of American history with respect to Black Americans and the results of systemic oppression and exclusion while reading it. I don't really have to prove this social condition, as it is an extraordinarily obvious condition of American life, and if you are unaware I simply ask you to examine the quality of school funding of Black neighborhoods, redlined districts, and the rates of incarceration and imprisonment. In many ways, slavery has never quite left America and it exists strongly in the US prison system. At the same time, the US banking sector has played a significant role in this system.

It is actually pretty interesting coming from a background of undocumented Mexican parents. My parents were born in the 60s, during an era where Black Americans were fighting for their rights in the Civil Rights Movement. So in some ways, the children of Black Americans that aged through that period have parented what is effectively first-generation "free" Black Americans in their own country. So in the same fashion that many Latinos do not have generational wealth or connections is a familiar experience for Black Americans, despite not being immigrants.

This is important to understand, and a reader will NOT be able to understand this investment without that historical knowledge. This is due to the company being lead by a CEO who pushes the company to create access to Black Americans, which I will get into detail and explain why Jay-Z even sits on the board of directors of this company. 

An additional note - Square is company that owns several services that you may recognize like Cash App, Tidal Music, and is lead by the current CEO of Twitter. Square holds a special place in my heart as an engineer in the financial technology and banking-as-a-service sector. It also holds a special place in my heart because the CEO approaches banking from a culturally sound perspective.

Square's stake in Jay-Z's music platform and Jay-Z's joining of the Square board of directors is an incredibly thoughtful application of this worldview on financial services and was not done as some cheeky "cool" business choice.  What it ultimately was is an intersection between hip-hop entrepreneurialism, culture, advertising markets, and future currencies services like Bitcoin. The ultra-long term view of Square is that it will eventually underwrite and manage higher risk industries like mortgage or even cannabis markets as a means to provide equitable services to the underbanked.

### 3.1. The Fundamental Constraint

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/119937615-f0479500-bf3f-11eb-9dbe-1db0c2411352.png)


This may not be immediately clear to understand, because it somewhat requires you to understand banking regulation, identity management, and digital compliance with respect to money-laundering, fraud, and other criminal intentions. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer.

A fair amount of people may know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over already existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank for particularl services while Square partners with Sutton Bank to be able to distribute virtual cards through Cash App. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain access to regulatory requirements. In a way, then, banks are somewhat of an exchange server in a network.

It may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, trustworthiness and accountability must be established. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), or the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). This is why it's required for a customer to place their address and social security numbers when registering for platforms like Robinhood, which is ultimately known as KYC or Know-Your-Customer.

At the same time, alternative currencies like Bitcoin or network structures like the blockchain challenge these frameworks in a rather surreal way.  According to investors like Charlie Munger, these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime. But what this also means is that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first that must essentially verify that you aren't an undocumented immigrant, a drug trading criminal, or a terrorist. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth which is exactly where banks fall into institutional oppression. Again, as mentioned earlier, it's critically important to understand the nature of BSA, AML, or FinCEN as these frameworks were effectively supercharged after the September 11 attacks.

This is the fundamental constraint in the fintech sector. To be able to verify a user is who they say they are and their risk profile when it comes to accepting and utilizing loans.


### 3.2. Bitcoin Markets
It is, then, no secret as to why Square invests in and researches alternative currencies like Bitcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank.  Enter Jay-Z, a business leader who is particularly focused on creating generational wealth.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/119938176-da869f80-bf40-11eb-90c2-c869374d3fc2.png)

This research into KYC can take many different forms. For example, a recent popular mechanism and protocol has been the non-fungible token or NFT, which is effectively a digital autograph that verifies that a digital good is assigned to a seller and purchaser with a documented history. We've seen rather bizarre experiments of this tool, like the selling of a Tweet, but a much more simple case would be the sale of collector/limited edition digital albums on a platform like Tidal. At this point, some things may start to click when it comes to this discussion at large. It is ultimately up to the platform to verify that that the collector album is authentic, such that purchasing and reselling the album on the platform is valid and cannot be duplicated. This is really just an interface change - a simple icon or even color coding that can't be duplicated by outside users.

You may see this as silly at first, but it makes perfect sense from an economic perspective. When it comes to a digital album or even digital clothes, it helps to imagine how much _time_ is spent on these platforms. The value we assign to these digital products is ultimately an expression of time that it consumes. For example, a child who spends several hours on Roblox a day may at times value their digital shoes more than shoes created by "real" material in the "real" world. Well, what if you bought digital shoes that were once worn by your favorite artist who also happens to play the same game?

The above examples are just light demonstrations to paint a picture, but it really helps to just see the whole KYC problem as a structural issue with the internet. What alternative currencies incentivize is to treat digital financial services as a protocol over a platform, which is something that Jack Dorsey often campaigns for. Is a Tweet really a property of Twitter, or is it closer to an email that's generated by some network protocol like POP or IMAP? Is a tip on a stream a property of Paypal, or is it a financial service protocol?

### 3.3. The Underbanked

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/119938884-e888f000-bf41-11eb-9fb3-b19c005cfa3c.png)

The story that drives the fintech industry is to be able to distribute resources and services that have largely been ignored or abused by traditional banking markets. Given the regulatory constraints, the fuel are underbanked customers while the combustion is produced by cybersecurity and AI tooling that allows for rapid validation of truth for each user each time a customer generates a transaction.

This relationship between AI tools and customers is known as a KYC problem and the organizations that figure out the best solutions will inevitably dominate the industry. You may have witnessed some of these issues in recent events, like the mass exiling of Robinhood customers who wanted to transfer their funds to another platform and the problems that came with it. This KYC problem is a large contributor to the customer service issues that are pervasive in the fintech space; where the ability to distribute services is far easier than it is to manage and provide support for.

It is clear as day that a focus on underbanked customers is the primary goal of Square, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America and  Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers.  This relationship can be examined geographically, where southern US states have adopted Cash App services over Venmo.  Similarly Venmo will reign supreme in areas like north Chicago suburbia while Cash App will have a stronger preferences in South Chicago neighborhoods.

The reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water where nearly half of the population is not guaranteed the resource by circumstance. That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square’s youth and culture strategy is that it builds effectively develops a life-long trust with the organization. You’ve heard it before:
 
> “why doesn’t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?” 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/119940047-87fab280-bf43-11eb-816e-629fb4881dff.png)


Square is attacks this pulse by offering the following opportunities to underbanked and first-time customers; The ability to: 

1. Start a business
2. Invest and educate oneself in securities investments.
3. Save on basic transactions

And in the near future, according to their progress as a company: 
1. The ability to manage taxes.
2. The ability to utilize fair loans that are meant to crush markets like payday advances or unfair terms.

## 4.3. Equitable Markets

We likely won’t even see Square operating at “full-force” until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square. There are many clear paths that one can infer from the organization if you piece together their product offerings and general strategy.

1. Square is already in the process of chartering and completing the regulatory needs to become a bank in order to service and originate loans, which is a completely different pathway from Big Tech payment processing services like Apple or Google Pay. 

2. Square's focus on alternative currencies is an attempt to disrupt regulatory environments created by the BSA, AML, and FinCEN, resulting in a potential opportunity to create new processing and gateway rails as a way to compete with organizations like Mastercard and Visa. This is a huge opportunity to challenge increasingly frustrating fees that harm industries like Doordash or even gaming organizations like Epic and Roblox.

3. Square can extend its business APIs to enter the Banking-as-a-Service industry as a leaner organization than services like Plaid or Stripe Treasury, who depends on banks like Evolve Bank.

4. As a function of Square's focus on underbanking and neglected historical customers, the end-game organization will challenge the banking industry as a whole by issuing loans for cannabis entrepreneurs and assume the risk of underwriting mortgage loans. 


### Conclusion

Investors are often nervous about Square's current price point, and rightfully so. Howevever, I believe it's a huge mistake to risk undermining the long-term value of what Square is attempting to accomplish in the big picture. The reputation of the American and global banking industry is not necessarily a good one and the nature of the banking or financial services industry is often a  reckless or high-stakes one.

In my view, Square has the right leadership behind it that's continuously capitalizing and pressing on an industry that has more or less buried its own grave. As aptly put by the CEO of Chase bank:

> “Absolutely, we should be scared s---less about that. We have plenty of resources, a lot of very smart people. We’ve just got to get quicker, better, faster. As you look at what we’ve done, you’d say we’ve done a good job, but the other people have done a good job, too. Competition will be particularly tight in the world of payments. I expect to see very, very tough, brutal competition in the next 10 years. I expect to win, so help me God.”
