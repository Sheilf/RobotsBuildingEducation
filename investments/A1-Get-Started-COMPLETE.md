This document attempts to describe a system that:

- Is cost effective and accessible for any range of income. 
- Incentivizes curiosity.
- Adapts to the investor that uses it or grows it.

Ultimately, what the following strategy written is a strategy knowing as “Focus Investing” which is a style that embraces volatility and rigorous decision-making.

The reason this document is written is because there are systems in place that allow for automated investments for as little as a dollar a month. That is an incredible tool that opens access to the markets from people’s pockets that otherwise would never be able to invest. The goal of the document is to guide an investor past two major beginner hurdles:

1. Investing in your first stock
2. Keeping your decision-making process under control

### TL;DR

The art of investing will always be based on the practice of making good decisions and the practice of maintaining the correct temperament through the good times and bad. You have to be comfortable missing out and you have to stay confident in a self-respecting strategy.


### The Setup

There are three primary components, so it will cost an investor as little as $3 a month. The automations that allow this to happen are:

- Monthly scheduled deposits
- Dividend re-investment
- Recurrent $1 ***daily***/weekly/monthly investments

The three components that work together in a step-by-step assembly-line:

- Save cash to be prepared for proper opportunities.
- Maintain a pool of sound and common sense ideas to control decisions(ETFs)
- Create a list of assets that feel as valuable as property such that initially purchasing and finally selling the asset is a time-consuming process.

My recommendation is the following on a recurring schedule:

1. Purchase $1 of your favorite company that you analyze rigorously.
2. Purchase $1 of SPY ETF to diversify
3. Hold cash to practice having saved cash for good opportunities.
4. Never allow yourself to hold more than 10 assets.

The reason that I recommend this setup is because you will inevitably have a million questions that may feel like they need to be answered. And often times you best choice is to not make a choice at all. Your goal, again, is to master the decision-making process and not the action of actually investing.

It is the nature of feeling uncertainty to ask many questions as a means to gain control, but truthfully, most of the best investments are often the most obvious ones in your respective expertise. An auto-mechanic that figured out to invest in Autozone and Home Depot is fundamentally as effective as a PhD engineer that invests in Tesla.

You are young. So take your time. Time will always be your most valuable asset, so use it and spend it wisely. 

This is my current setup using this system, after modifying for knowledge and experience, of which I write about each investment in great detail.
