# The First Generation Investor
### Working Draft Edition 3.0.1

## Foreword

It’s likely that you’ve discovered this writing through TikTok, which is the only distribution channel that I’ve considered at this point in time. Truthfully, these writings are for myself and as a mechanism to organize my thoughts over a long period of time.

I’m a first generation Mexican American that has found himself writing software for the California tech sector during what I consider a rather unique period in history. How I arrived here is a long story of consequences and a story that I imagine many Latinos are familiar with.

I have also found myself in various types of vocations, ranging from construction, factory work, or even in the development of farms. Overall, I’ve really reached a point of comfort in the fact that I particularly enjoy writing and investing as a way to understand the world. I discovered that people seem to enjoy my ability to teach or explain ideas. My discovery in writing originates from my posts on Reddit. It was the first instance where I started to gain a “following” for any kind of activity that I did.

I want to keep the readings accessible, so I will make an effort to write in simple language. To keep the essence of the rest of this book short - I believe we live in the early innings of the most consequential period in human history. Through our time together, I would like you to consider some thoughts:

1. We may live in a period of tech-colonization. Consider the idea that a nation like Mexico is unlikely to develop competitors for things like Apple, Intel, or Google. If you search for the largest market capitalizations in history, big technology firms are hovering around a similar size to colonial powers like the Dutch East India Company or the Mississippi Company and has far surpassed economic phenomenons like Rockefeller’s Standard Oil. In some ways, organizations like Apple, Visa, or Google can be seen as modern railroads - and in some ways are reflective of the robber barons of the past. 

2. Many readers may be familiar with how fiery the stock market was after the events of 2020 pandemic. It is clear, at least to me, that the internet has developed to the point where it defines our economy and position in the world. The market is a far different reflection than the events of 2000, where technology was still in a toddler state. The internet and its consequences are far more “real” now.

3. The future of this world may remember this point in history that we live in similar to how we view cavemen. We’re essentially the writers on the wall through applications like Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, and other ways of utilizing the internet. The American legacy is ultimately a technological empire that will be remembered.

4. I feel that the internet effectively ages with me which grants me and some readers a unique perspective and experience with the system. One way I like to express this idea is that I’m the first generation to play games online with other players as a child in the **entire history of the world**. The internet is 31 years old at the time of this writing. I am 27. This is what a First Generation investor really is - the digital native.

5. It’s OK to disagree with my views. I’m okay with accepting that an organization like Roblox has educational value, which may motivate me to explore a company more. At times, investing can and should be a philosophical experience. For example, what are the consequences of gaming and how does an application like Robinhood benefit from the nature that exists with our relationships to games and learning?


That being said, I hope that reading this helps you understand the world that we live in, I hope that it challenges you, and I hope that you enjoy it. Thank you for reading!


# 2. Pinterest 

It likely makes sense to discuss and break down what a social network really is, since it is something that has significantly changed human behavior in recent history.  As an investor, I like to invest in what I consider “intent-based” social media and this is likely a function of my age and relationship with the internet. An intent-based social media platform is a network where the user is likely to use the application as a tool before considering entertainment. 

In short, social medias exist on a spectrum ranging from intention to entertainment. One could see how a platform like TikTok is geared toward entertainment, while a platform like Pinterest is designed for intention. In this spectrum, we find many interesting cases in middle like YouTube, Twitter, or Reddit.

A social media platform is a forum. It is a place where revolutions occur and this is rather indisputable at this point after the banning of American presidents or the resulting chaos of financial markets. A forum is “ a place, meeting, or medium where ideas and views on a particular issue can be exchanged”. Each forum accomplishes this in its own unique way.

In the way that Twitter is fundamentally used to search for what someone is saying, Pinterest is used to search for ideas.
Pinterest is particularly interesting in the sense that hundreds of millions of women users have adopted the platform for its intent to find and discover ideas. I believe this is consequential and as a reflection of improving education conditions for women. From an internet history perspective, Pinterest has essentially accomplished what Google+ failed - a social media platform harnessing the power of search.

It's important to understand this distinction when investing in internet forums like Facebook, Twitter, or Snapchat because an investor would not want to mistaken comparisons between companies like Home Depot or Walmart. Sure, both organizations exist in the retailing space, but the nature of the business, its incentives, and its customers are worlds apart. 

So is Pinterest a social media platform or is it a search service? Or is it both? In what way does this explain how Facebook implementing hashtags or Instagram implementing stories as totally irrelevant information?

What drives a social-networking site is a user’s incentive to search or discover information in that particular forum. As a result, examining social-networking sites can be a lot like comparing shopping centers, such that a shopper is incentivized to go to a location for a particular reason that is best served by that institution. Pinterest uses pins, Reddit uses subreddits, and Google uses links - all having unique advantages as a means to distribute information.

The forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. If we try to categorize it roughly, a forum's shopping center would look like this:
- Google is fueled by user’s need for answered information.
- Facebook/TikTok is fueled by a user’s need to connect.
- Pinterest is fueled by a user’s need for ideas.
- Reddit is fueled by a user’s need for community.
- Online video games are fueled by a user’s need for adventure.


With this basic model, you can argue which forum may be most valuable. In my view, human nature seems to value:
1. Google (need for information)
2. Games (need for adventure)
3. Reddit (need for community)
4. Pinterest (need for ideas)
5. Facebook (need to connect)

I believe that people really underestimate how quickly humans find new ways to connect and can move to another platform for connection; which is also quite a common occurrence in online gaming.  The reason I rank Facebook as one of the weakest long-term relationships is because we have witnessed multiple transformations in the connection space, while the company has had to take advantage of early acquisitions to essentially escape death through WhatsApp and Instagram. Even today, we see attempts by Facebook to enter markets with children, workspace, groups, and shopping as a means to resist consumer behavior changes made by organizations like TikTok, Discord, Roblox, Slack, and Pinterest. 

Pinterest is closer to the adoption of applications like YouTube or even Reddit in some cases, where users aren't necessarily sharing their profiles with friends and use the applications to search for information that they find meaningful to them. In the same way that a user on Reddit searches for a group's opinion, or a YouTube customer searches for tutorials, Pinterest is used to generate and discover ideas.


Consider this economic relationship:  what are the demographics of male underwear shoppers and who do male underwear brands market to? Why?

The network-effect that built Pinterest has mostly been driven by women across all social-economic statuses, resulting in  profound economic consequences across global households. What this ultimately results in is word-of-mouth adoption, where families learn how to use Pinterest as a tool and search engine, rather than an application to connect with friends or family. As a result, Pinterest’s recommendation model is geared to advertise to women-influenced interests, which we will touch on shortly.

This has long-term positive consequences for product advertisers regardless of culture - which is exactly why Pinterest is performing remarkably well with international user adoption, while most of the American customers have already been effectively registered, where nearly 100 million American women are monthly active users. 

You can try it yourself to understand; it feels like what you wish Google Images to do for you at times:
- Recipe, exercise, diet ideas
- Birthday gift ideas
- Skincare and self-care ideas 
- Tips for traveling to another area
- Home construction


These are customers voluntarily searching for ads. Behaviorally, this means that Pinterest’s customers are in a “high willingness to engage” with things that result in “action”. That is, a Pinterest user is logging in because they need to start, plan, and consume something in the near future. Customers do not need to be influenced into a product when the customer is coming onto the application with completely different expectations and incentives to search and shop. This is basically a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know they’re getting top "real estate" advertisement.

Pinterest users have an incredibly high willingness to engage as a function of using the social platform as a useful tool above all else. This willingness to engage inevitably translates into a willingness to pay. Pinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content to discover random nuggets of entertainment. It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy outside of Pinterest so that the customer develops a positive relationship with the tool. That is fundamentally different than Facebook’s connect-everything approach to social-networking.


You may wonder why Pinterest essentially dominates the Google Images real estate when searching for particular images. This is a pretty complicated question to answer since the search engine optimization market is relatively new. As a rule of thumb, try to imagine that Google Search is more or less "the web" where website links are the lifeblood to Google search. A good link is extremely valuable to Google.

Due to this relationship, it's in Google's interest to attempt to create a system that best serves their customer by offering the best, fastest, and most well-rounded results. This means that the most utilized or most well-developed websites are often the top results in a Google search.  This partially explains why searching for "Lebron James" today will result in search results by websites like Twitter, Wikipedia, Instagram, and other supersites.  Similarly, searching for "Vegan food near me" will produce results by organizations like Yelp and Doordash.

There are many other reasons of course, but this is a rough rule of thumb: the more "well-developed" a website is, the more likely that it will dominate web search results. As the web progresses, the definition of "well-developed" changes. An example of this is that Google begins to rank and prefer websites that implement privacy, page-load speed, and other important internet accessibility practices. This benefits organizations like Pinterest who develops tools like in-app browsers and supports integrations with applications like Zoom, Etsy, Shopify, and other large-scale platforms.

Why is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor and global leader. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet’s development to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe. The internet is ultimately “access to information”, which is as numerically scarce as “access to clean water” around the globe. So it’s carefully considered in strong engineering communities. In this regard, Google and Facebook compete rather aggressively.

I totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life which is one of the most inelastic markets to breech. I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest customers are essentially sustainable top-dollar advertising spaces since users are looking directly to consume as a result of their usage which is far different than other social-media platform strategies with influencing.

I use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest - I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. This is why Facebook is concerned with daily active users while Pinterest is centrally focused on its monthly active userbase. That, to me, is incredible.
