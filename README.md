# 1.0 Introduction
This essay is being written for my two friends, Dimitri and Edwin, due to the fact that they've long shared interest and concerns when it comes to making wise or effective investments over the years. Each of us are on different stages of our lives with similar outlooks - we seek more effecient use money such that we can enjoy or better afford other facets of life, like building a healthy family or opening opportunities to build interesting careers.

Here are a few core principles that I use in my thought process. They're here to create mental models to make decisions that are concerned with correctness and effectiveness.

### 1.1 Guidelines

1. Investing is inherently closer to philosophy than it is a science. Understanding financial sheets is important, but understanding a business with scale becomes a more more complex issue to resolve and understand.

2. Investing in stock is similar to a baseball game. The major difference is that you're not punished for not swinging.

3. Invest in what you really know, not what you think you know. It's a good practice to reject good ideas that aren't under your umbrella of real knowledge. You want to be an expert on the subject, not someone who is speculating on good ideas.

4. Diversification is protection against ignorance. This is a useful counter-measure for rule 3 above. Investing in more things produces a more predictable and less volatile average, which is what many people depend on for their retirements. Diversification should be a representation of confidence and knowledge.

5. Holding or saving cash is never a bad idea. This is a useful counter-measure for rule 2 above. Many investors will argue that holding cash is bad because it is inflationary. My view is that this is a case of over-engineering statistical facts. The trade-off of cash is that it's immediately liquid and can be used for a variety of things, whether it be a business, stock, vacation or home. Cash is an investment in choice.

6. Art and financials are theoretical economic elements. Neither are fundamentally productive. Financials is systemtic regulation. Arts is creation in flux. Both are important for survival through periods of change. 

7. Most amateur investors suffer from "incentive-caused bias". This bias can be incredibly useful or produce incredible ignorance. In a nutshell, we have a tendency to want to get people to do what works for us. Be careful of this, as it can promote damaging confirmation bias or promotion of misinformation. 

8. Be biased toward companies that generate profit or allocate revenue in highly effective ways. Companies that are highly effective at growing revenue building profit are companies that can effetively hold cash for strong investments or strategic pivots.

9. Most wealth is rooted by a few decisions. The decision to start a business or receive an education are some common examples.

10. The market's economics is not zero-sum. They are relationships.


### 1.2 Productivity

The way to make money grow is to be productive and marketable with it. The relationship between complexity and productivity is inversed - more productive assets usually tend to be more complex to scale or start. More producitivity results in higher utilization of money, resulting better with potential returns on investment:

1. Running a business
2. Investing in business
3. Investing in property
4. Owning static assets like cash, gold or an education.

Most people's temperaments have them align with 2 & 3, where using property and indexed retirement funds results in the majority of their wealth. It is not a bad default combination by any means because it simply requires you to build marketable employment, save and invest in common sense things. Other people seek to accelerate this process.

My hope is that these two frameworks allow you to appreciate how complicated yet simple selecting an investment is. I would argue that there is no such thing as a good or bad investment, only investments that are right for you.

# Gaining Knowledge
 
I think the most valuable domain of knowledge in the current age of the stock market is having a strong understanding of history and macroeconomics. It is difficult for me to get past the notion that we live in a remarkable period of economic change and I use history to better regulate that. With respect to history, technology is just further engineering and research performed on electricity, so in a way, the economic lessons of centuries before still upholds truth today. This allows us to observe companies like General Electric, a company that was spawned off the ideas of Thomas Edison and J.P Morgan in the Gilded Age of American history. What had they accomplished to lead the American market and persist for over a century? What changed?

That being said, it's equally important to not be carried away by the wonder of fascination of this shift in human behavior. 

The economic period I like to look at to understand internet and computing investments is what is known as the Browser Wars (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars). This was the period of development before and after the dot-com boom that created the competitive, standardized and consolidated the landscape for web development or internet engineering.

It's easy to be biased toward the future, especially if you try to search for the "next big thing". The truth is that the next big thing is often in front of you for a very long time and its awfully boring. They become elements of life itself rather than life-changers. Why are you not sick of Coca-Cola despite it being the same experience for decades? Why do you trust certain brands over others? What gets you to spend or operate flows of money?

The goal of finding a good investment is to understand the sincere staples of society rather than the disrupters. What genuinely solves real problems and improves the quality of the day-to-day? So rather than looking for shiny toys and flash-in-the-pan coins, you would look for opportunities that solve real business problems and embed into the household or industrial use. 

As a result, studies into great and recognizable companies like Apple, Costco, Disney, and other powerhouses is a good place to start and are the kind of things that influence me as an investor looking for good opportunities. What incentivizes customers to use Costco? How were they designed and why were they designed this way? What about these companies allowed them to reach the level of scale and industrial wonder that they are?

There are likely many opportunities that we have recently experienced - things like Zoom or Uber that are sufficiently obvious, but my goal is not to select any good opportunity. As mentioned earlier, you're not punished for swinging, even if a pitch is good. How many pitches that are good or bad doesn't matter. All that matters is that when you swing, you swing well and hit the ball.


# Top Investments (stakes larger than 10%)
Block, Pinterest, Zoom 

As mentioned before, the Browser Wars is an economic event that I often use to organize my mental models. The important lesson learned from the Browser wars is that a company's previous decisions and designs inform its path for development and its opportunity to pivot. The case I'm trying to make is that an organization like Google, which is much younger than companies like Microsoft and Apple, was able to have particular industry capitulate as a result.

Google did one thing well: search. It had designed a registry and index that was optomized for its intent - to search for and organize websites, and in many cases, user's really only need technology to do one thing very well in order to make economic impact. The proliferation of web technology is such that the availability of something does not imply the usability of it. 

This in part explains why internet services like Yahoo and AOL eventually declined despite their overwhelming market shares. Google did one thing incredibly well and was then trusted as the way to interface with the internet at large. Because of this, its transition and strategy into web browsers was able to challenge companies that distributed it from their operating systems or computers like Microsoft and Apple. This pattern of design continued. Google Maps, conversational AI, YouTube, Gmail,and other services all point to that historical trust and path of development.

The point is, Google's design informed its ability to compete with much larger companies that were providing or initiating similar services like internet browsers or social media. Its design created different economic opportunities that were not in the strategic plan for its competitors. Apple was not a distributor for advertisements and their need and resources allocated to web browsers was not the same. Apple's principal concern was the development of operating systems and IoT.

So these are characteristics I look for when relating these companies and their larger competitors. How well does the product capture its principal design so that it can afford a longer and more productive lifespan?

### Zoom
June 16, 2022



Let's start off with the most simple case. Remote work. Zoom is a case of a company working on one thing, video, and experiencing a gold-mine of opportunity as a result of that decision. Zoom works well, across devices, across internet speeds and is easy enough for anybody to use, almost immediately. This is different than services like Microsoft Teams, Slack, or Discord, whos primary designs are around searhable logs of text, app integrations, communication channels and identity. 

Zoom's economic advantage is that it sits on video-first constructions and develops from that vantage point of a camera. As a result, it has developed infrastructure layers for other applications to embed its services into their products. Zoom is able to create and sell products like Zoom Phones and other professional hardwares as a result - which is a much different endeavor and direction than other digital office applications. It also allowed the company to focus on the key element of reducing the cost of development of a product in order to better distribute it. 

This is how they're able to afford free usage of the product and still generate strong revenue growth and profit. They do video in a more standards-compliant reliable way and IT budgets will experience a high willingness to pay for it. This is something that secures their product in budgets in critical industries like education, healthcare and government communications.

Live video data is also really valuable, expensive to process, distributed by few means, and underdeveloped from a networking perspective. We have crude and early versions of it through services like Twitch and Youtube, but these services are mostly parasocial relationships or one-way. This nuance between what kind of video is captured is actually important, since the set of data collected by these relationships informs how AI products like Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa work. Zoom, on the other hand, tends to process video and audio data in a professional conversational setting, allowing the company to work on tools like conversational AI, customer service experiences and business intelligence in a fine-tuned way with an incredibly large set of high-quality transcripts. 

It also allows it to develop services to solve specific problems related to multi-directional streaming. What are solutions that peer-to-peer tutors need? How do you enforce privacy with medicine and government calls? How do you develop collaborative video and audio tools for higher stakes and regulated professional settings?  How do these new collaboration protocols standardize such that other organizations use it in their infrastructure? How do you best utilize or invent hardware for your user's experience and their expected user setting? I've always imagined this idea of "web 3" to be primarily driven by the camera and networks ability to handle video with improved network speed and bandwidth.

The reason Zoom succeeded in an era governed by cloud services is because it built a reliable service with a strong architectural focus around processing video inexpensively. This is why it was so easy to send colleagues links to Zoom links in the first place or why they were able to embed and whitelabel their product under other services, since being able to develop a product that onboards rapidly and "just works" for everybody often takes signficant contribution. From a common sense perspective, investing in video and streaming infrastructure checks out. The camera is simply an important piece of technological real-estate that sees enormous development and Zoom appears to be an apparent data-bank for its video.

### Block

Block is how I invest in Bitcoin. The truth about Block is that it's also an investment in the healing of how banks have failed certain demographics in the past due to certain American and international consequences. It's primary lines of business are Square points of sales, Cash App wallets, TIDAL music streaming, and two Bitcoin research companies. The current suite of primary products capture the idea of building services with the intention of defining or creating generational wealth. Square is a service that allows you to start a business with intelligence, Cash App allows you to buy and use your first stocks or Bitcoin, TIDAL allows you to make a living off distributing art and the current Bitcoin research is focused on improving financial services and regulatory conditions across social networks like Twitter.

Other that that, I view Bitcoin as a currency primarily governed by machines before being a serviceable tool for people, no different than how US dollars flow through regulatory financial pipelines before being issued by an employer or consumer. It's a form of automation. Before ever being scaling financial service on a platform like Twitter or Tiktok, you need to make systemic changes to how social relationships function so that algorithmic banning does not overregulate users utilizing these financial services; which then becomes a legal regulatory and access related problem. 

The difference between a bank and social media closing an account is that a bank does not prevent you from contacting clients outside of the means of business. This not true for social media, where relationships are owned by the media service rather than the one who created the service. This will be important when we discuss Twitter, which is working on similar technology protocols.

In short, current proof-of-work algorithms are resolve arbitrarily difficult problems that validate some conceptual economic system. In the future, I don't believe those proof-of-work algorithms will be needlessly difficult, but fundamentally useful outputs produced by advanced machines. My view is that Bitcoin is likely a necessary element to achieve advanced economic systems or idea like Universal Basic Income. Proof-of-work is ultimately a protocol for machines, robots or networks to prove and verify that work has been performed. Some of these will be inherently driven by people's needs, like our desire to find cures for cancer, our desire to communicate digitally, our desire to be fed recommendations, or our lack of desire to perform difficult labor.

This will clearly take many years but I would like to find companies that can best navigate and position themselves for those kinds of situations. Block appears to be a component of it while also providing fairly high quality services today.




### Pinterest
Pinterest is how I invest in the family. Pinterest is a search engine for ideas and plans. This is the most important thing to understand about why this organization is a good opportunity despite being one of the least frequently used yet top competitive social channel. The data that Pinterest has collected and been onboarded with are ideas and plans. So the user's that use the platform are experiencing an alternative version of social media, closer to how Google is used. It is designed around intent rather than entertainment.

The relationship that governs Pinterest is pretty amazing. It is a network largely adopted by women, so strongly that they grow rapidly in every nation where it is launched, with predictable outcomes. Just about 50% of every nation uses Pinterest monthly, which is mostly women with disposable incomes. This demographic also collides with the fact that many of these women have families, and in many families, they are the breadwinner in incomes.

In the same way that Google became dominant in browsers, due to its nature of being a data-search platform, or how Apple became dominant because it was intentfully designed around operating systems, my belief is that Pinterest will be one of the strongest shopping platforms in the future in a way where they will realistically compete with the likes of Amazon, Target or other large retailers that are having to adapt into technology.

The history of Pinterests and its principle design around pins is similar to that of Twitter, but geared more toward effective infographics. People created visionboards. They were plans, or ideas for the future. This system eventually progressed to more engaging short-form videos. For all platforms that are not in the advantageous position that Google and Facebook are, short-form media has performed remarkably poorly for services like Reddit, Tiktok and Twitter. They are poorly monetized. As it currently stands, Pinterest's development path is such that it is the most effective path to monetize short-form media. 

The reason for this is because advertiser's know that Pinterest's primary service is to improve shopping experiences. So a Target ad on Pinterest would perform fundamentally different than it would on Reddit or Twitter. This relationship is powerfully combined with other elements of Pinterest's business that points to a positive future with respect to building profitable services around shopping network in an era governed by companies like Amazon, Alibaba and SHEIN.




# Investment Offets (stakes less than 10%)
Cloudflare, AMD, Gamestop, Twitter




### Gamestop
Gamestop is how I invest in Ethereum. This will be difficult to explain. It helps to understand the history of web-browsers and operating systems to understand the unfolding of cryptocurrencies. To fast-forward, it's clear why web systems like Google had conquered the web-browser industry while operating systems like Apple and Microsoft secured the app-development industries. Simply put, the design of each product informed it's path, business cases and consequences of it. Facebook started as a .com while products like Adobe started with hardware inserts. Applications are applications, but the type of application is still an important distinction to understand.

This distinction exists for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum as well. Bitcoin and Ethereum are closer to application types than they are applications. So Ethereum is an environment, similar to how HTTPS and other internet protocols allowed for something like Google to be created, or how things like executable files allowed for environments like Apple or Microsoft to exist.

History will rhyme. There will be many great success, great close-calls and great failures and you will hear a new wave of exhausting stream of buzz words and other unimportant or unexciting features with great energy. This is not my concern in the industry. When it comes to investing in cryptocurrency, it helps to not view it as a tribal effort and to appreciate genuinely good technology underneath it. Some of these technologies are quite clear when reduced to their first principle.

1. Stablecoins - the ability to translate safely. This may be applied to cross-border or digital-services interactions like Roblox and Fornite or USD and MXN remittances.

2. NFTs - a history of signed ownership for digital assets. This will matter more as identity and virtualization of collections continues (games, CD/albums, books, seats in digital spaces, digital educations)

3. Decentralized Identity - the choice to use one profile across services such that you are able to collect your own data. For example, if I have a spotify account with 1000 songs and want to pay for Apple Music instead, I can store the data of those 1000 songs and provide it to Apple instead. If I decide to retire from Tiktok, I can keep my following or relationships on another platform.

4. ZK Rollups - Using compression methods outside of the blockchain to improve speed and quality of services.

5. Smart contracts - programmable agreements with an assigned financial or transactional value

The point I'm trying to illustrate here is that I don't recommend investing into tokenized implementations of these products or coins that are built around them. It's an unnecessarily risky way to go about it. What I suggest is to find services that wisely use these protocols to build larger and more reasonable network. Investing in protocols is a lot like investing in materials, where it's just far more productive for money to be utilized by productive services rather than the availability of static asset. Google is Google because it wisely used various web protocols like HTTP and email protocols like IMAP to index online communications. Apple is Apple for wisely using UNIX and BSD over the decades. 

With that whole damn spiel, I see that Bitcoin appears to currently be a system for machines-to-human interfaces, while Ethereum seems to be concerned with digital or gamified experiences. So this is my differentiation between crypto-based products from Block and Gamestop, no different than one must really distinguish products like Google and Microsoft or networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Considering this, I believe that the US doesn't accurately capture the gaming market, its culture, and the amount of consumption that exists with it:

1. There is no place where a 45 year old mother can purchase a reasonably good and custom computer gear for their child.
2. There is no place that's for popular media like anime or Netflix content.
3. There is no place that people can go to for e-sports related material, needs like streaming and content-creation, or social experiences like trading cards or board games.

So there is a missing set of incentives in the market with respect to Gamestop, and it's true that the company has suffered heavy blows through the digitalization of game sales. The way I see it, Gamestop is largely a store selling collectibles, whether they be physical game copies, trading cards, or NFTs. There lies my opportunity with Gamestop - its implementation of an NFT marketplace was wonderfully wise and correct since they're tying in valuable implementations created by the crypto community in order to create a stronger network and database of crypto related features. This is akin to what Google had done by developing web-services to create a network of online websites. Gamestop wants to be the place where gamers and content-creators sign digital assets across video games under their service. If you're following why silly images matter, it matters as much for gaming & media as silly blocks of texts mattered before they became Tweets, posts and blogs.


### Twitter
Twitter is how I invest in internet communications. There are few critical components to social networks which include the ability to search, chat or publish. They are searhable networks. Each social media is designed around different incentives in principles. We use google to search for information. We use Facebook search for connection. We have LinkedIn to connect with professionals. We have Twitter to see what someone is saying. Pinterest is used to search for and plan ideas. Reddit and Discord is built around community engagement. Roblox is where children connect and play.

Twitter is an interesting case in the sense that it was designed around the message. It is the only media where a publication is branded. A tweet is significantly different than a link on google, a post on Instagram, a chat on Discord or a thread on Reddit. It is basically one giant public chatroom where one is able to search for what someone else is saying through the day, week or event.

As such a Tweet is just the following:

```
User's Identity
User's message
Message date
Functions to engage with message
```

That's it. It's a great place to observe the non-zero sum nature of technology. Many amateur investors will say among the lines of, "there is no market for this product. I can already add a contact reply, like, and write messages inside of iMessenger. So why would I invest in Twitter?". The thing that fascinates me about the long-term prospectives of Twitter is that it's totally designed around being able to message, and thus finds itself proliferating on other social media platforms. It's more likely that you see Tweets reposted on things like Reddit, Instagram, news networks, and other social medias because of its inherent simplicty than it is likely that you will ssee a reddit post or instagram story on other platforms. It is also more likely that you can build entire social applications using Twitter's API, which is just atool that allows you to use their network to develop products. StockTwits is agreat example of this. 

Given the nature of Twitter's embedded design and its cultural ubiquity, it makes sense that they're also working on these decentralized identities as a way to challenge larger competitors with reputation and identity issues, namely Facebook & Google. We have discussed internet protocols and history before, and this organization is working on such protocols to amend for web related problems related to the ownership of data. These decentralized architectures ultimately depend on sound messaging and regulatory networkings - which is what Twitter and Block are particularly good at.

At this point, it helps to think about what was previously mentioned. Technology ebbs and flows. At one point, organizations like IBM were titans of the industry and created a certain set of new problems that companies like Apple and Microsoft resolved. Apple and Microsoft then lead new eras of technology, which introduced problems that organizations like Google and Facebook resolved. Today, many problems exist in identity and data networks that have been provoked by the identity platforms that have been designed by the inherent limitations of Google and Facebook.
