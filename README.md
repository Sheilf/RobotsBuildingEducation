### Working Draft Edition 3.0.3




## Foreword

The first-generation investor is ultimately the unique perspective of an age group that has aged alongside the development of the internet. I would like to consider that we may live in the early innings of one of the most consequential periods of human history. We may live in a period of tech-colonization where the central goal may be to further our capacity as a space-varying species. After the introduction of the coronavirus pandemic, I began to regularly ask what the purpose of the internet was. Personally, I've come to the conclusion that the internet is a form of interplanetary communications and that the efforts that drive Google, SpaceX, Amazon, and other complex organizations will converge toward that goal.

Consider the idea that a nation like Mexico is unlikely to develop competitors for Apple or Google. If you search for the largest market capitalizations in history, big technology firms are hovering around a similar size to the colonial powers of Dutch East India Company or the Mississippi Company and have far surpassed the economic phenomenon of Rockefeller’s Standard Oil. In some ways, organizations like Apple or Google can be seen as modern railroads or sailing ships while also being reflective of problems brought forth by the robber barons and colonialists of the past. It is clear that the internet has developed to the point where it defines our economy and position in the world after showing economic resiliency and strength throughout the COVID pandemic. The economics behind the internet today is far different than the famous internet bubble of 2000 where the internet was still in a child state. The internet and its consequences are far more “real” now. If we were to compare the technology bubble of 2000 to today; the cryptocurrency market is a far more appropriate comparison.

The future of this world may remember this point in history similar to how we view familiar primitives. We’re essentially the writers on the wall through applications like Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, and other ways of utilizing the internet. The American legacy is likely a technological empire that will be remembered along these lines. That being said, I hope that reading this helps you understand the world that we live in. I hope that it challenges you and I hope that you enjoy it.

# 2. Social Media Investing

It likely makes sense to discuss and break down what a social network really is, since it is something that has significantly changed human behavior. I like to invest in what I consider “intent-based” social media and this is likely a function of my age and relationship with the internet. An intent-based social media platform is a network where the user is likely to use the application as a tool before considering entertainment. In short, social media exists on a spectrum ranging from intention to entertainment. One could see how a platform like TikTok is geared toward entertainment, while a platform like Pinterest is designed for intention. In this spectrum, we find many interesting cases in the middle like YouTube, Twitter, or Reddit.

A social media platform is a forum. A forum is “a place, meeting, or medium where ideas and views on a particular issue can be exchanged”. Each forum accomplishes this in its own unique way. In the way that Twitter is fundamentally used to search for what someone is saying, Pinterest is used to search for ideas. Pinterest is particularly interesting in the sense that hundreds of millions of women users have adopted the platform for its intent to find and discover ideas. I believe this is consequential and as a reflection of improving education conditions for women across the globe. From an internet history perspective, Pinterest has essentially accomplished what Google+ failed, which was a social media platform harnessing the power of search.

It's important to understand this distinction when investing in internet forums like Facebook, Twitter, or Snapchat because an investor would not want to mistake the differences between companies like Home Depot or Walmart. Sure, both organizations exist in the retailing space, but the nature of the business, its incentives, and its customers are worlds apart. So is Pinterest a social media platform, search service, or both? With this in mind, we might begin to see why Facebook implementing a hashtag, Instagram implementing stories, or TikTok implementing streams may be irrelevant when understanding the full potential of a service like Snapchat or Twitter.

What drives a social-networking site is a user’s incentive to search or discover information in that particular forum. As a result, examining social-networking sites can be a lot like comparing shopping centers, such that a shopper is incentivized to go to a location for a particular reason that is best served by that institution. Pinterest uses pins, Reddit uses subreddits, and Google uses links - all having unique advantages as a means to distribute information.

The forum may take on a different medium. Google is used to answer information, Facebook allows us to connect, Pinterest helps us discover ideas, Reddit allows us to build active communities, while online gaming satisfies our needs for adventure. When you examine the nature of a forum and a user’s incentives to participate in that forum, you’ll come to understand why a force like Twitter, Pinterest, or online games like Roblox are a force of nature. These forums engage our very real needs and demands as social beings.

Pinterest is closer to the adoption of applications like YouTube or even Reddit in some cases, where users aren't necessarily sharing their profiles with friends and use the applications to search for information that they find meaningful to them. This is what is known as “personal media” rather than typical “social media”.



The network-effect that built Pinterest has mostly been driven by women across all social-economic statuses, resulting in profound economic consequences across global households. What this ultimately results in is word-of-mouth adoption, where families learn how to use Pinterest as a tool and search engine rather than an application to connect with friends or family. As a result, Pinterest’s recommendation model is geared to advertise to women-influenced interests, which we will touch on shortly.

This has long-term positive consequences for product advertisers regardless of culture - which is exactly why Pinterest is performing remarkably well with international user adoption. Most American customers have already been effectively registered, where nearly 100 million American women are monthly active users. 
Recipe, exercise, diet ideas
- Birthday gift ideas
- Skincare and self-care ideas 
- Tips for traveling to another area
- Home construction


These are customers voluntarily searching for ads. Behaviorally, this means that Pinterest’s customers are in a “high willingness to engage” with things that result in “action”. That is, a Pinterest user is logging in because they need to start, plan, and consume something in the near future. Customers do not need to be influenced into a product when the customer is coming onto the application with completely different expectations and incentives to search and shop. This is basically a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know they’re getting top "real estate" advertisements. With a simple search, you’re welcomed to a rich library of consumable ideas for health, gifts, beauty, travelling, home developments, and millions of other regularly marketed products.

Pinterest users have an incredibly high willingness to engage as a function of using the platform as a useful tool. This willingness to engage inevitably translates into a willingness to pay. Pinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content to discover random nuggets of entertainment. It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy outside of Pinterest so that the customer develops a positive relationship with the tool. That is fundamentally different from Facebook’s connect-everything approach to social-networking. It is less wasteful and more effective.


You may wonder why Pinterest essentially dominates the Google Images real estate when searching for particular images. This is a pretty complicated question to answer since the search engine optimization market is relatively new. As a rule of thumb, try to imagine that Google Search is more or less "the web" where website links are the lifeblood to Google search. A good link is extremely valuable to Google.

Due to this relationship, it's in Google's interest to attempt to create a system that best serves their customer by offering the best, fastest, and most well-rounded results. This means that the most utilized or most well-developed websites are often the top results in a Google search.  This partially explains why searching for "Lebron James" today will result in search results by websites like Twitter, Wikipedia, Instagram, and other supersites.  Similarly, searching for "Vegan food near me" will produce results by organizations like Yelp and Doordash.

There are many other reasons of course, but this is a rough rule of thumb: the more "well-developed" a website is, the more likely that it will dominate web search results. As the web progresses, the definition of "well-developed" changes. An example of this is that Google begins to rank and prefer websites that implement privacy, page-load speed, and other important internet accessibility practices. This benefits organizations like Pinterest who develops tools like in-app browsers and supports integrations with applications like Zoom, Etsy, Shopify, and other large-scale platforms.

Why is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor and global leader. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet’s development to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe. The internet is ultimately “access to information”, which is as numerically scarce as “access to clean water” around the globe. So it’s carefully considered in strong engineering communities. In this regard, Google and Facebook compete rather aggressively.

I totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life which is one of the most inelastic markets to breech. I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest customers are essentially sustainable top-dollar advertising spaces since users are looking directly to consume as a result of their usage which is far different than other social-media platform strategies with influencing.

I use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest - I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. This is why Facebook is concerned with daily active users while Pinterest is centrally focused on its monthly active userbase. That, to me, is incredible.
